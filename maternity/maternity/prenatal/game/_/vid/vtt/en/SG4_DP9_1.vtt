1
00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:06.856
I get 160 beats per minute.
This is an expected rate.

2
00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:10.856
It's so cool to hear
my baby's heart rate.

3
00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:14.096
It seems real now.

4
00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:16.806
I'm really pregnant.

5
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.736
It is cool.

6
00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:20.876
Many women say
the same thing.

7
00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.086
It really sinks in
that they're pregnant

8
00:00:23.086 --> 00:00:25.106
when they hear the
baby's heart beat.

9
00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:33.585
Here's a tissue for the gel.

10
00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:37.276
Now I'm going to ask
you some questions

11
00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:38.976
about your nutrition.

12
00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:40.546
You can sit up if you like.

13
00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:51.326
Do you take any vitamins?

14
00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:53.696
I started taking
prenatal vitamins

15
00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:55.196
but they upset my stomach.

16
00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:58.106
What do you mean by
"upset your stomach?"

17
00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.666
I felt nauseated
after taking the pill

18
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.686
and I couldn't eat my
breakfast or I would vomit.

19
00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:06.366
So I stopped taking them.
