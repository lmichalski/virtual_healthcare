00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:03.126
This low blood pressure
is an expected finding

2
00:00:03.126 --> 00:00:04.776
in healthy pregnant women,

3
00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:06.756
especially in the
second trimester

4
00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.776
due to hormonal changes.

5
00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:11.296
The low blood pressure
can make you feel dizzy,

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.296
especially when standing up.

7
00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:15.136
So, I would suggest
you get up slowly,

8
00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:17.186
if sitting or lying down.

9
00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:19.066
Okay. Good to know.

10
00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:20.676
Have you peed recently?

11
00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:22.836
Yeah, just before
I came in the room,

12
00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:24.236
I left the urine
sample right there.

13
00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:26.026
Oh good, thanks.

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.746
I need you to lie down
on the examination table.

15
00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:31.136
You can take the
pillow with you.

16
00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:33.266
I'm going to measure
the fundal height,

17
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.296
which is the size of
your uterus and gives

18
00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:37.926
a measurement of
the baby's growth.

19
00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:50.936
Okay, I need you to
life your top, please.

20
00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:52.846
And undo the top
button as well.

21
00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:56.766
Okay, there it is.

22
00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:00.586
Okay. So, I get
18 centimetres.

23
00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:03.006
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is that normal?
