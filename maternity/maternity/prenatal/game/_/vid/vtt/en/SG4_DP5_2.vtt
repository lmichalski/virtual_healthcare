00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:02.776
The fundal height is a bit
lower than expected,

2
00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:05.386
since you're 20 weeks
pregnant, which indicates

3
00:00:05.386 --> 00:00:07.356
to us that your baby
might not be growing

4
00:00:07.356 --> 00:00:08.766
at the expected rate.

5
00:00:08.896 --> 00:00:11.916
So is something wrong, do
I need to be eating more?
