00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:03.006
Based on your BMI, the
average you should gain

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:07.166
during your pregnancy is
between 11.5 to 16 kilograms.

3
00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:09.996
Okay. So I guess I should
be monitoring my weight

4
00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:11.496
and watching what I eat.

5
00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:13.246
We will be weighing
you at every visit

6
00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.486
to monitor your weight gain.

7
00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:16.556
We will also have a handout

8
00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:18.616
on dietary guidelines
for pregnancy.

9
00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:20.436
I could get you one if
that would be helpful.

10
00:00:20.606 --> 00:00:22.156
Yeah, that could be helpful.

11
00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:23.696
Oh, I still need
to dip your urine

12
00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:26.256
for protein before you see
the nurse practitioner.

13
00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:29.636
Okay. I have been
peeing a lot lately.
