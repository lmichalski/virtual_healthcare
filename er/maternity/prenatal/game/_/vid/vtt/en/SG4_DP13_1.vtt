00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:03.346
In healthy pregnancies,
mild to moderate exercise

2
00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:06.016
poses no threat to
you or your baby.

3
00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:08.086
In addition, it can help
prevent a number of

4
00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:10.646
health conditions, such
as excess weight gain

5
00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:12.676
or gestational diabetes.

6
00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:15.036
So I would encourage you
to continue to exercise.

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.416
Great. So I can keep running?

8
00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:20.606
And if I wanted to increase
activity, is that okay?

9
00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:23.006
If you'd like to start
additional activity,

10
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.696
I would suggest low-impact
activities like brisk walking,

11
00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:30.166
indoor stationary
cycling, or prenatal yoga.

12
00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:32.546
But if you have any
spotting, bleeding,

13
00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.436
severe abdominal pain, back,
or side pain, cramping,

14
00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.706
or contractions, you need to
notify your healthcare provider.

15
00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:42.526
Okay. So as long as I
feel good I can exercise?

16
00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:45.106
Yes. At each visit,
we'll see how you

17
00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:46.586
and your baby are doing.

18
00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:48.956
And if you need to adjust
your exercise routine,

19
00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:50.546
we'll let you know.

20
00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:52.136
I'm going to get the
nurse practitioner

21
00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:53.806
to come and
assess you now,

22
00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.376
and I'll also get
the information

23
00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:57.316
on diet during pregnancy.

24
00:00:57.336 --> 00:00:59.726
I'll bring it to you after you
see the nurse practitioner.

25
00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:01.466
Okay. Thank you.
