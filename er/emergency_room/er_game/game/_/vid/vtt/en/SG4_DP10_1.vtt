00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.530
Try taking your prenatal
vitamins at night, before bed.

2
00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:05.616
Many pregnant women
find it helps with

3
00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:06.976
the stomach irritation.

4
00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:10.034
You can also try taking your
prenatal vitamins with

5
00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:11.904
drinks high in vitamin C.

6
00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:13.225
Oh, like orange juice?

7
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.980
Yes.

8
00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:16.414
Okay, yeah, I drink
a lot of orange juice.

9
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.750
This helps with the absorption
of iron that is in the vitamin.

10
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.940
Prenatal vitamins contain folic
acid, which is important for

11
00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:24.764
the development of your baby.

12
00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:27.583
You want to be sure
to take it regularly.

13
00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:30.738
After your bloodwork is done,
the nurse practitioner will know

14
00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:33.798
if you need additional
iron supplementation.

15
00:00:33.798 --> 00:00:36.358
At this time, I'm going to
measure your weight.

16
00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.589
65.8?

17
00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:50.148
Do you know how much you
weighed before getting pregnant?

18
00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:54.452
Uh, yeah, six months ago,
I was about 62 kilograms,

19
00:00:54.452 --> 00:00:56.732
so I gained almost
four kilograms.

20
00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:58.172
And about how tall are you?

21
00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:59.369
5' 7".

22
00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:02.140
Your BMI would be about 21 or 22.

23
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.790
Okay. How much should I be gaining?
