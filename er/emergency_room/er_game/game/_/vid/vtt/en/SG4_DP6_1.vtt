00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.256
The fundal height is
based on the number

2
00:00:02.256 --> 00:00:03.926
of weeks of pregnancy.

3
00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:06.826
Often, at 20 weeks,
you're 20 centimetres.

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.506
You will have an
ultrasound soon

5
00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:10.216
to assess your
baby's growth.

6
00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.456
At this point, we're
not concerned.

7
00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:13.966
We'll measure the
fundal height again

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.356
at your next visit.

9
00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:16.316
Okay.

10
00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:20.166
Did you notice that weird
line running down my belly?

11
00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:22.116
I noticed it about
three weeks ago,

12
00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:24.676
and I don't know what it is.
