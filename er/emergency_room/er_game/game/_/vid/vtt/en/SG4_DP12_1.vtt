I have found no
protein in your urine.

2
00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:52.306
Testing the urine for
protein is a regular test

3
00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:53.986
for all pregnant women.

4
00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:56.146
We will check it
at every visit.

5
00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:58.906
The reason we test the urine
for protein is for signs

6
00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:00.916
of a condition called
pre-eclampsia.

7
00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:02.896
Okay. I've heard of that.

8
00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:05.245
Do you have any other
questions for me before

9
00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:07.106
the nurse practitioner
assesses you?

10
00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:10.656
Yes. So I run about 5K every day

11
00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:12.566
and I was wondering
now that I'm pregnant,

12
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.556
what activity I'm
allowed to do?
