00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:03.816
Do you have anyone to support
you during this pregnancy?

2
00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:07.086
Yeah. My family's here.

3
00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:08.436
I just moved
back to Toronto

4
00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:11.926
after finishing
school in Vancouver.

5
00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:15.006
My ex-boyfriend was
there and we broke up

6
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:16.466
before I knew
I was pregnant.

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.636
So, he has no idea, yet.

8
00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:21.486
I do have an ex-girlfriend
here, though,

9
00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:23.546
and she's really
been there for me.

10
00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.256
So, do you feel
you have people

11
00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:27.856
that will support you
during this pregnancy?

12
00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:31.826
Yeah. Thankfully, I do
have a lot of support here.

13
00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:34.776
We also have some prenatal
groups here at the clinic

14
00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:37.326
that we can talk about
later if you're interested.

15
00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:42.636
Sure. Also, I don't really
know exactly when I'm due.

16
00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:46.556
And I think that might
help me to prepare.

17
00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:48.396
Well, let's figure it out.

18
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.126
I need to know the date of
your last menstrual period.

19
00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:52.966
Oh, okay.

20
00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:02.346
So, it was February second.
