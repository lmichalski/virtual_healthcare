00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.805
I'm going to take
your pulse rate.

2
00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:21.116
Your pulse rate
is 98 and regular.

3
00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.136
It may be that the
pulsations I heard

4
00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:25.726
when assessing the fetal
heart rate are yours.

5
00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:28.436
So, I'm going to retake
the fetal heart rate.
