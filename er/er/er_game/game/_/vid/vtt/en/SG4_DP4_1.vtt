00:00:00.356 --> 00:00:03.186
Are your menstrual
periods regular?

2
00:00:03.376 --> 00:00:08.376
Yeah, so, I get them every four
weeks, and it's never late.

3
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.156
Do you use contraceptives?

4
00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:16.186
Just condoms,
most of the time,

5
00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:19.616
but I've never used
anything else.

6
00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:25.076
Your baby's expected date of
birth is November 9th or 10th.

7
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.866
That would make you about
20 weeks pregnant now.

8
00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:32.926
Okay. Yeah, that
sounds about right.

9
00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:36.746
So, now I'm going to do your
vital signs to see how you

10
00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:39.336
and the baby are
doing. Is that okay?

11
00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:40.476
Sure.

12
00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:43.916
I'm going to need you
to remove your jacket.

13
00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:13.876
It's important to be
still while we do your

14
00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:14.976
blood pressure.

15
00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.186
Your blood pressure is 98/63.

16
00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:06.816
Do you know what your
blood pressure normally is?

17
00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:11.886
Oh, yeah, so, six months ago,
at my doctor's, it was 120/80.
