The line is called linea nigra
and is believed to be related

2
00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:07.046
to the changing hormones
or imbalance of hormones

3
00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:08.976
as a result of your
developing baby.

4
00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:12.096
Will it always be there?
Is it going to go away?

5
00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:14.366
After pregnancy,
it'll go away.

6
00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:17.226
But it will be there for
the rest of your pregnancy.

7
00:00:17.456 --> 00:00:18.196
Oh.

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:21.240
I'm going to assess
your baby's heart rate.

00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:39.636
[ Heart Beating ]

10
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.306
There it is.

11
00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:47.516
[ Heart Beating ]

12
00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.363
I get a fetal heart
rate of 98.
