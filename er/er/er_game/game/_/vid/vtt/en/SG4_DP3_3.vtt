I get October 26.

2
00:00:04.906 --> 00:00:06.886
That doesn't sound right.

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.596
This is based on
Naegele's Rule,

4
00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:10.696
which is the last
menstrual period

5
00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:14.096
plus seven days
minus three months.

6
00:00:14.416 --> 00:00:16.806
Oh, I think I made a mistake.
